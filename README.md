## Computational Scripts in R, Bash and Python
A collection of reusable scripts I’ve written for
bioinformatics, data analysis, and research workflows.

### Highlights
- SNCA Variant FASTA Generator: This script generates FASTA sequences for wild-type SNCA and selected missense variants using Biopython. It was created to address the limited availability of curated SNCA variant FASTA sequences through online browsers. The reference sequence was obtained from UniProtKB (P37840), and amino acid position changes were verified using the UniProtKB Variant Viewer.


Each script is self-contained and documented.
